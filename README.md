## Hi there ğŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Business Informatics study for a semester abroad in Finland.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Webdevelopment and many other skills.
- ğŸ“ˆ I've already learned some VBA, to use Excel UserForms, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Angular, React, Typescript, Javascript, NodeJS and Java.  
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like sports and music.
